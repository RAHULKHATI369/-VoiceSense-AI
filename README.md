## 🌟 About VoiceSense

VoiceSense isn't just an assistant —  
it's a **listening friend** that understands **what** you say and **how** you feel.

- 🎧 Listens carefully like a true companion
- 💬 Detects your emotions (happy, sad, neutral)
- 🔍 Senses if you are telling the truth or not
- 🎭 Talks in a humanized, friendly, heartwarming style

---

## 🚀 How It Works

1. Greet VoiceSense ("Hello VoiceSense")
2. Tell it to "check his/her feelings" OR "detect if he/she is telling the truth or lying."
3. Watch it respond with emotional, warm feedback — never robotic, always human!
